# Vaga - Retail scale
Retail scale communication (sending products).

This is for communicating with Mettler scales (using transl). 

Connect to MS SQL Server, fetch data, send data with information like Name of product, price etc.
There is basic after fetch data editing (just in case).

File with commands: vaga.kom
File with response: vaga.odg

Also credits for this project goes to my co-author Domino.

PS: 
- this is old project made with Delphi
- it won't work without BDE installed
- don't ask for VCLs
